# GriddlerSolverJS

A griddler puzzle solver written in JavaScript.  
This was done as a side project with no real purpose... It was just pure fun.  
This project is also referenced from a post in my blog [Orange-Coding](http://orange-coding.blogspot.com): [Griddlers Solver](http://orange-coding.blogspot.com/2014/05/griddlers-solver.html)

To play, go the [Griddler Solver](https://yinonavraham.github.io/GriddlerSolverJS/griddlers.html) page.

## Key Features

* Includes several examples of griddler puzzles
* Manual griddler solving
* Automatic griddler solving by the solver
* The solution is iterative and is animated (fun! fun! fun!)

An example of a solved griddler:
